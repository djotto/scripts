# scripts
Ad hoc scripts. Mostly junk.

## Typewritten

Scripts I wrote to batch process some microfiche scans. I thoroughly recommend [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) for this kind of work.

## Video

Scripts for comparing video files.

## git-scripts

<dl>
  <dt>git-info</dt>
  <dd>echoes information about the current repo to stdout in a human-readable form.</dd>
  <dt>git-seek</dt>
  <dd>checks out a partial branch name (useful when the branch name is based on a ticket number)</dd>
</dl>

## misc

Scripts that don't fit anywhere else.

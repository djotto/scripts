# scripts
Ad hoc scripts. Mostly junk.

## Typewritten

Scripts I wrote to batch process some microfiche scans. I thoroughly recommend [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) for this kind of work.

## Video

Scripts for comparing video files.

## git-info

git script that dumps info about the repo to stdout in human-readable form.

## git-seek

git script that checks out a partial branch name.
